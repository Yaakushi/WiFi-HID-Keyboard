For this project, you want to run the esp in transparent mode, the most common way to do it is by using the original AT command firmware.

Using a ESP01 and a serial to usb adapter, configure it to run as an access point and operate at transparent mode (converting the data to the given socket to serial).

There is a lot of better tutorials online for this purpose, I just went with the quickest solution possible... Please take everything I say with a grain of salt, this commands worked for me, but may not work for you.

Commands used:

AT
should respond OK, if it respond ERROR, try sudo AT
... 
no, just kidding, THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS
... 
but really, if it responds ERROR to the AT command, try updating the firmware. If it doesn't respond at all, send the command below:

+++
if it's already in transparent mode, it should return to config mode. Else, check connections and usb to serial adapter software (I'm using HTerm for Windows) configurations.

AT+CWMODE_DEF=2
AT+CWSAP=""predebon,"",5,0
access point with ssid=predebon and no password

AT+CIPSTA_DEF="192.168.6.100","192.168.6.1","255.255.255.0"
fix IP, now login on the access point with your WiFi device, check your IP

AT+SAVETRANSLINK=1,"192.168.4.2",6666,"TCP"
my IP was 192.168.4.2, so I created a TCP client on port 6666 for my IP, to send data I'm using TCPClient for Android
